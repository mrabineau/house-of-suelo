        <p> When will that be? Oh yeah, good luck with that. Why, those are the Grunka-Lunkas! They work here in the Slurm factory. Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase.
            Ugh, it's filthy! Why not create a National Endowment for Strip Clubs while we're at it? Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything. You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see! I can explain. It's very valuable.
            I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas. Calculon is gonna kill us and it's all everybody else's fault! Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all.
            Then we'll go with that data file! Tell her you just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Oh God, what have I done? I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though! </p>
